# LSDTopoTools Resolution Analysis Tools from Grieve et al 2016

This repo contains the code used to perform all of the topographic analysis described in an upcoming paper in EsurfD.

This code is part of the [LSDTopoTools software package](http://lsdtopotools.github.io/).

The versions here are updated on a semi regular basis. 

For instructions, go to the [LSDTopoTools documentation website](http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/) and download the raw data for the associated paper [here](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/Res_Data/Res_Data_Pack.zip) and the plotting code [here](https://github.com/sgrieve/Resolution_Paper_Figs).
